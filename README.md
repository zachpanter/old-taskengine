# TaskEngine

**Mantra**
Tasks are opportunities to turn possibility into competence.

**Analogy**
We are like steam-locomotives. We have places to go, timetables to meet, and things to see along the way.

To do this, we need fuel. We need maintenance. We need to coordinate our travels.

Our fuel is the work we have to do. Like coal, we function best when our actionables are broken down into discrete, atomized tasks.

Our maintenance is encompassed by the habits that keep us running smoothly. Like oil, a good set of habits ensures whatever lies ahead (academically, emotionally, spritually), we are prepared to handle it.

We need to be prompt and punctual. Reminders help us to keep a schedule and deliver on time.

**Overview**

TaskEngine uses Kanban and Agile methods to help track both projects and day-to-day tasks.

It encourages habit-building through recurring tasks (reminders). These tasks can be set to respawn with the functionality expected from modern calendaring services (weekday, M/W/F, T/Th, weekend, day-of-month, every-X-days/weeks/..., etc.)

It promotes deep understanding of backlogs through a tree-based task hierarchy that allows a parent task to be composed a number of child-tasks.

Scrum-points are used to estimate task and project completion schedules. 'Burndown' and 'Velocity' visualization gives users the ability to track progress and reevaluate current approaches.
